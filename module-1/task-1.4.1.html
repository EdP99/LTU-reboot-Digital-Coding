Reflection

In today's session I learnt that the web development industry is a rewarding, creative and potentially lucrative industry.

I also introduced myself to the rest of the class.

The part that I enjoyed the most was setting off on the new learning journey.

In today's class we had an introduction to the fundamental tools used in web development and potential careers associated with coding and programming.

The best part was getting an overview of the industry.

1.3 - 11/11/2020

Reflection

Today we learnt about internet concepts and fundamentals.

It was great to finally understand the difference between the internet and the worldwide web. 

The best part was that the concepts were explained in simple language.

The heardest part was that sometime the pace of the lesson seemed to drag a little.

1.4  - 12/11/2020

Reflection

Today we learnt the basics of how to set up a code platform using Github and about code editors.

The best part was getting hands-on information about the tools used.

The hardest part was that some students had problems using the software and this slowed the pace of the lesson.

1.5 - 13/11/2020

Reflection

Today's lesson included a Github demo and lots of info on useful apps, tools and forums to explore coding issues.

The best part was receiving useful info about sites and tutorials that have been 'validated' by the course leader.
