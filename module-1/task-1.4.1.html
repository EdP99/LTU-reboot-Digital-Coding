1.1 - 09/11/2020

Reflection

In today's session I learnt that the web development industry is a rewarding, creative and potentially lucrative industry.

I also introduced myself to the rest of the class.

The part that I enjoyed the most was setting off on the new learning journey.

1.2 - 10/11/2020

Reflection

In today's class we had an introduction to the fundamental tools used in web development and potential careers associated with coding and programming.

The best part was getting an overview of the industry.

1.3 - 11/11/2020

Reflection

Today we learnt about internet concepts and fundamentals.

It was great to finally understand the difference between the internet and the worldwide web. 

The best part was that the concepts were explained in simple language.

The heardest part was that sometime the pace of the lesson seemed to drag a little.

1.4  - 12/11/2020

Reflection

Today we learnt the basics of how to set up a code platform using Github and about code editors.

The best part was getting hands-on information about the tools used.

The hardest part was that some students had problems using the software and this slowed the pace of the lesson.

1.5 - 13/11/2020

Reflection

Today's lesson included a Github demo and lots of info on useful apps, tools and forums to explore coding issues.

The best part was receiving useful info about sites and tutorials that have been useful to Luke, the course leader.

1.6 - 16/11/2020

Reflection

In today's lesson we learnt about the uses of HTML and CSS and about the anatomy of an HTML element.

The best part was having the various elements, attributes and values explained in simple language.

1.7 - 17/11/2020

Reflection

Today we learnt about additional HTML elements, how to create links, the different types of links, how to insert images and link them, line breaks and lists, how to insert comments and tables.

The best part was learning about further code elemets and being able to use them in our tasks.

The hardest part was that I faced hardware challenges with my computer giving me a 2 second delay in every action and often freezing when moving between apps. It was very difficutl to folow the lesson as I was always catching up

1.8 - 18/11/2020

Reflection

Today we learnt about CSS, the basic CSS syntax rule, the 3 different ways to connect to HTML and how declarations works with a property and value.

The best part was understanding the basic concept of styling html.

The hardest part was completing the tasks with a slow computer and not much time for error or referral to notes.

1.9 - 19/11/2020

Reflection

Today's class was difficult in that I missed the first 15 minuts as Microsoft Teams would not open and kept crashing. I had to sign out and sign back in. From then on I was playing catch up and missed some key content re. ID's and Classes.

The hardest part is following the lesson and getting my slow computer to play ball. I know Luke is trying to foster independence with the tasks, but I would prefer it if he demonstrated each task in full and got us to do it with him. We would then be free to try it for ourselves after the class. I often find myself forgetting how to write a particular tag or create a link for example, and this requires going back to notes. Not much time for that so I often fall behind!
